# Data Types

# Strings
# You CAN add a square bracket to determine where in a string you want to pull that character from
# For example in the word hello. if I put [0] the H will get printed

print("Hello"[4])


# Integer is used for whole numbers without any decimal places

# You can add _ instead of commas for very large numbers
print(123 + 456)


# Float another data type. It is short for a floating point number used for decimal place numbers


# Boolean, another data type. It only has 2 possible outcomes. true of false

True
False

# Always used with a capital letter

a = float(1.23)
# You can use the 'type' data type to help you find out what kind of data type is present
# you can change a data type and turn it into a string by putting inbetween the parenthesis of a str() data type
print(type(a))
